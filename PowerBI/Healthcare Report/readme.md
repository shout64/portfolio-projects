# Sample Healthcare Data Report

This report uses sample data from kaggle. You can find a [copy of this data here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset/data).

## Process
- Started by cleaning the data. This involed fixing the *case* on all of the patient names and making sure all the fields used the correct formatting.
    -  Since this is sample data, I also added a column for Paid Amount to use for comparison.
